# somenumpystuff

This is a mix of stuff I wrote for the PNI bootcamp and stuff they
previously had lying around (which might be your stuff).  I think I
also borrowed some ideas from repos that Henry has which in turn might
also involve some of Jim Pivarksi's stuff (ask Henry for those repo URLs).

The exercises might be useful.
